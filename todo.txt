set up the donate stuff (figure out a system to use to donate. some examples are pure paypal donations, but there is also things like 
patreon, patreon is prob the better one as it is recurring payments and with enough could pay for the server and website unlike paypal 
which is one time purchases and isn't very sustatiable, that being said if paypal is chosen it would be a high one time price compared to
patreon which would be low but monthly recurring so more people would be willing to chose it) 

TLDR for the above: pateron is better system for this type of server with dedicated community that doesn't change to much
tiers: $5, $10, $20 or something similar. the twenty wouldn't be much different but it be to more like "if you really want to help it is appreaciated or something on those lines"
